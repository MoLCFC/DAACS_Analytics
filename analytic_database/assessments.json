In 1917 he created the Curtiss Autoplane, an unsuccessful hybrid of airplane and car.\n    In the 1920s the \"King of the Air\" found that he hankered to get back to his lifelong\nloves of hunting, fishing, and camping.

Unlike any other species on Earth, human\nbeings have the ability to look back in time and to learn. We know the strengths of the great\nancient civilizations as well as the catastrophic mistakes that crumbled empires. It was the\ntraditional explorer who blazed a trail to this past. The new explorers-all of us-must use\nthat trail to find our way to the future, to chart our course, and our children's course, into\nthe unknowns ahead.\n    The past age of the lone explorer, Boorstin<sup>1</sup> wrote, opened at a time when medieval \ncartographers did not place \"North\" at the top of their maps. At the upper margins of their\nparchments they drew instead a mysterious spot they imagined in the east: paradise, which\nno living human had ever entered. Monks, looking for this garden \"where Earth joins the\nsky,\" became the first explorers; next, pilgrims wandered in search of the holy place; then\ncrusaders forged into new lands in the name of God; and finally, missionaries infiltrated \nfarther into Earth's unknown corridors-all of them pushing back the boundaries of their\nworld in quest of paradise.\n    On one of my own voyages, I think I found it.\n    <i>Calypso</i> was exploring the waters of the Aleutian Islands, in Alaska. We sailed into an\nunreal world-the sky, the ice, the water, all brushed by the indescribable light that makes\ndusk indistinguishable from dawn during the season of the midnight sun. After I dropped\nanchor off the island of Unalaska, our chief diver, Raymond Coll, climbed into our diving\nsaucer and took it down for a search under the surface of the sea. Raymond, who stayed in\ncontact with me by sonar telephone, described walruses and whales, vast pink fields of\nkrill-icy waters that brimmed with life.\n    Above, on board <i>Calypso</i>, the team was uncharacteristically preoccupied with another\nendeavor altogether. NASA had just landed a module on the moon, and the entire <i>Calypso</i>\ncrew crowded onto the fantail to listen raptly to the radio, awaiting the announcement that\na human being, Neil Armstrong, was about to step onto the lunar surface.\n    Excitement electrified the atmosphere on board. We barely breathed. And then,\nArmstrong's voice. A cheer rose from the deck and echoed in the crystal air. I switched on\nmy sonar link with Coll. \"Raymond! Historic news! Armstrong is walking on the moon!\"\n    I felt a proud sense of fraternity that day with the NASA explorers who were reaching\ninto the distant corners of space even as our little team explored the depths of the sea. Yet\nI also felt a sense of privilege that had to do not with the astronauts, but with the wet, blue\nEarth on which they were gazing. Out in space, a human being stepped through dry lunar\ndust. But Raymond sailed through a myriad<sup>2</sup> of life, undersea on the solar system's only\nplanet awash with liquid water.\n    Several years later, the astronaut Alan Bean spoke to me about his own space voyage.\nFrom the moon, he watched Earth spin through cycles of night and day.

It was just an\nold habit he had, left over from wilder times: checking, looking for [a] sign of one kind or\nanother, honing his instincts, as much as anything. In his years as a Ranger captain it had\nbeen his habit to get off by himself for a time, every night, out of camp and away from \nwhatever talking and bickering were going on. He had discovered early on that his instincts\nneeded privacy in which to operate. Sitting around a fire being sociable, yawning and \nyarning, might be fine in safe country, but it could cost you an edge in country that wasn't\nso safe. He liked to get off by himself, a mile or so from camp, and listen to the country, not\nthe men.\n    Of course, real scouting skills were superfluous in a place as tame as Lonesome Dove,\nbut Call still liked to get out at night, sniff the breeze and let the country talk. The country\ntalked quiet; one human voice could drown it out, particularly if it was a voice as loud as\nAugustus McCrae's. Augustus was notorious all over Texas for the strength of his voice. On\na still night he could be heard at least a mile, even if he was more or less \nwhispering. Call did his best to get out of range of Augustus's voice so that he could relax\nand pay attention to other sounds. If nothing else, he might get a clue as to what weather\nwas coming-not that there was much mystery about the weather around Lonesome Dove.\nIf a man looked straight up at the stars he was apt to get dizzy, the night was so clear. Clouds\nwere scarcer than cash money, and cash money was scarce enough.\n    There was really little in the way of a threat to be looked for, either. A coyote might\nsneak in and snatch a chicken, but that was about the worst that was likely to happen. The\nmere fact that he and Augustus were there had long since discouraged the local\nhorsethieves. ...\n    He tried hard to keep sharp, but in fact the only action he had scared up in six months\nof watching the river was one bandit, who might just have been a <i>vaquero</i><sup>1</sup> with a thirsty\nhorse. All Call had had to do in that instance was click the hammer of his Henry-in the\nstill night the click had been as effective as a shot. The man wheeled back into Mexico, and\nsince then nothing had disturbed the crossing except a few mangy goats on their way to the\nsalt lick. ...\n    But somehow, despite the dangers, Call had never felt pressed in quite the way he had\nlately, bound in by the small but constant needs of others. The physical work didn't matter:\nCall was not one to sit on a porch all day, playing cards or gossiping. He intended to work;\nhe had just grown tired of always providing the example. He was still the Captain, but no\none had seemed to notice that there was no troop and no war. He had been in charge so\nlong that everyone assumed all thoughts, questions, needs, and wants had to be referred to\nhim, however simple these might be. The men couldn't stop expecting him to [c]aptain, and\nhe couldn't stop thinking he had to.

With a length of 24-26 inches and a\nwingspan in excess of four feet, this iridescent black bird presents an imposing sight \nespecially when it skillfully executes hawk-like flight motions during courtship displays and\nwhile guarding its nest. The raven, you see, is a bit of an aerial acrobat and seems to fly for\nthe sheer joy of it. Rolls, somersaults and even level flight upside-down may be the most\nspectacular behaviors the casual birder will be able to observe.\n    Because both birds are large, black, and similarly shaped, it can be hard to tell the \ncommon raven from the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In addition to being\nsomewhat larger, ravens have a heavier beak with a decided \"Roman nose\" appearance.\nThey also have shaggy throat feathers, called hackles, which can be slicked down or fluffed\nout, apparently to aid communication. In flight, their rounded, wedge-shaped tails and\nfeathers resemble extended fingers near the ends of their wings. ...\n    The raven is both predator and scavenger. Although omnivorous, most of its diet is \nanimal matter, including insects, lizards, frogs, rodents and the eggs and young of other\nbirds. In addition, it regularly dines on carrion<sup>2</sup> and garbage.\n    The raven's sometimes inexplicable and genuinely annoying habits-they've been\nknown to harass livestock and pets, pilfer golf balls and peck holes in the skins of \nunattended light airplanes-led to human reactions that thinned its ranks, particularly in\nthe Northeast. This bird has made a remarkable comeback in the last few decades, \nhowever, partly due to its ability to take advantage of the presence of people. The raven can\nsurvive everything from arctic to desert conditions, often aided, ironically, by garbage\ndumps and other artifacts of human settlement. ...\n    Raven pairs stay together throughout the breeding season and usually bond for life.\nCourtship displays generally begin in February, just before breeding. Pairs often return to\nprevious nesting areas and begin a spectacular aerial courtship ritual. They perform unison\nflight maneuvers, sometimes circling their chosen nest site with wingtips nearly touching.\nOccasionally, the male takes steep, sudden dives or tumbles in mid-air. Feather-preening\nseems to be a common activity while earthbound.\n    Ravens prefer remote, forested areas with tall coniferous trees or rocky ledges where\nthey can build nests and catch air currents that loft them into soaring flights. They also nest\non rugged seacoasts and forested marine islands, as are found off the coast of Maine. ...\n    Nests tend to be built in solitary places, typically miles from other raven nests.\nSometimes, new nests are built atop old ones, although nesting pairs may alternate among\ntwo or more sites in the same nesting area from year to year. In this way, the best nesting\nareas can be used for 100 years or more. ...\n    Many a researcher has discovered firsthand the cunning ways of the raven.

We could see it from the roof of the\ntenement where we lived, the stone towers rising below us from the foreshortened streets\nof downtown Brooklyn. We saw it in newspapers and at the movies and on the covers of\nbooks, part of the signature of the place where we lived. Sometimes, on summer afternoons\nduring World War II, my mother would gather me and my brother Tom and my sister,\nKathleen, and we'd set out on the most glorious of walks. We walked for miles, leaving\nbehind the green of Prospect Park, passing factories and warehouses and strange \nneighborhoods, crossing a hundred streets and a dozen avenues, seeing the streets turn\ngreen again as we entered Brooklyn Heights, pushing on, beaded with sweat, legs rubbery,\nuntil, amazingly, looming abruptly in front of us, stone and steel and indifferent, was The\nBridge.\n    It was the first man-made thing that I knew was beautiful. We could walk across it, \ngazing up at the great arc of the cables. We could hear the sustained eerie musical note they\nmade when combed by the wind (and augmented since by the hum of automobile tires),\nand we envied the gulls that played at the top of those arches. The arches were Gothic, and\nprovided a sense of awe that was quite religious. And awe infused the view of the great \nharbor, a view my mother embellished by describing to us the ships that had brought her\nand so many other immigrants to America-the Irish and the Italians and the Jews, the\nGermans, the Poles, and the Swedes, all of them crowding the decks, straining to see their\nnewfound land. What they saw first was the Statue of Liberty, and the skyline, and The\nBridge. The Brooklyn Bridge. ...\n    There was a long time in my life when I didn't see much of The Bridge, except from the\nroof or the back window. The reason was simple: Trolleys were replaced by automobiles,\nand nobody I knew in our neighborhood owned a car. But then when I was sixteen, I got a\njob in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a sheet-metal worker, and at lunchtime we would wander\nout along the cobblestone streets beside the dry docks, and from there we could look up at\nThe Bridge. \"Now the cats that built that,\" a black welder named Fred Thompson said to\nme one day, \"they knew what they were <i>doin'</i>.\"\n    They certainly did. As I grew older, I came increasingly to see The Bridge as a \nmonument to craft. It was New York's supreme example of the Well-Made Thing. All\naround us in the sixties, the standards of craft eroded. As aestheticians<sup>1</1> proclaimed the\nvirtues of the spontaneous, or exalted the bold gesture, or condemned form as an artistic\nstraitjacket, I would cross The Bridge and wonder what they could mean. More than \ntwenty men were killed in the construction of this thing, and others were ruined for life by\naccidents and disease suffered in its service. To those men, carelessness meant death, not\nsimply for themselves, but for the human beings who would use what they were making. So\nthey had no choice: They had to make it to last. And in doing so, in caring about detail and\nfunction and strength, they saw craft triumph into art. ... \n    Of course, it is the nature of all bridges that they travel in two directions.

Holding her\ncell phone in one hand, she took a piece of antler in the other and gently struck each blade\nonce. Over a bad transatlantic connection, our phone conversation had been difficult, but\nthe tones from the four-inch-long blades came through-clear, sweet, and crystalline.<sup>1</sup> They\nsounded like hand bells or struck goblets. The blades are replicas of 30,000-year-old \nartifacts from the sites of Isturitz in the French Pyrenees and Geißenklösterle in \nsouthwestern Germany.\n    Blake, who is the granddaughter of an opera singer and the daughter of a pianist, is an\narchaeology graduate student at Cambridge University. One of the newest members of a\ndeveloping sub-discipline, the archaeology of music, she is basing her research on the\nhypothesis that our earliest ancestors discovered and enjoyed a peculiar property of some\nstone tools-they rang. ...\n    The major difficulty that prehistoric musicologists face is that it's so easy to make music\nwithout leaving a trace. In addition to dancing and singing, hunter-gatherer cultures used\nnatural materials to create instruments. Native Americans shook rattles made from gourds.\nAustralian aborigines played instruments called didgeridoos fashioned from huge tree limbs\nor bamboo. The San of southwest Africa plucked the gut strings of their wooden hunting\nbows. What are the odds these would survive for thousands of years to be found (let alone\ncorrectly identified) by an archaeologist? The best anyone can expect to discover is when\nhumans first began to create reliable and durable instruments.\n    Graeme Lawson, an independent archaeologist in England who heads a multidisciplinary<sup>2</sup>\norganization known as Cambridge Music-Archaeological Research believes that some\nobjects now on display in museums may actually be misidentified musical artifacts. One\ncase in point is a medieval \"garment clasp\" that was made from a pig knuckle. Lawson \nanalyzed the wear patterns and polish around a hole that had been drilled through the \ncenter of the bone and showed they were consistent with the patterns found on \"buzz\nbones,\" a type of noise maker that was used as a children's toy in some parts of Europe until\na few decades ago. When the knuckle bone was tied to a string and whirled through the air,\nit would have made an eerie, ghostlike sound.\n    How many ancient objects now labeled as \"garment clasps\" were actually used as noise\nmakers? How many flint artifacts doubled as chimes? There's plenty for an avid music\narchaeologist to do without ever touching a spade.\n    The oldest indisputably musical artifacts are flutes (experts call them \"pipes\") made\nfrom the bones of birds.

Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. ...\n    Low-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat-usually 107 degrees Celsius \n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes.

The hermetic seal is essential to ensure that microorganisms do\nnot contaminate the product after it is sterilized through heating, says Dignan. Properly\ncanned foods can be stored unrefrigerated indefinitely without fear of their spoiling or\nbecoming toxic. ...\n    Dignan also notes that foods packaged in materials other than metal cans are considered\n\"canned\" by food processing specialists if the food undergoes the canning preservation\nprocess. Thus, today a canned food may be packaged in a number of other types of \ncontainers, such as glass jars, paperboard cans, and plastics that can be formed into anything\nfrom pouches to soup bowls to serving trays. ...\n    Foods with a naturally high acid content--such as tomatoes, citrus juices, pears, and\nother fruits--will not support the growth of food poisoning bacteria. In tests, when large\nnumbers of food poisoning bacteria are added to these foods, the bacteria die within a day.\n(The exact amount of time depends upon the bacteria and amount of acidity.) Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. ...\n    Low-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat-usually 107 degrees Celsius \n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes. (The amount of time the food is heat-\ned, though, depends upon the size of the container and the product.) The canned food \nis heated in a retort, a kind of pressure cooker. ...\n    Another critical element in the canned food process is sealing products in airtight \ncontainers. It is essential that air be removed from the container before sealing. Air could\ncause the can to expand during heating, perhaps damaging the seals or seams of the \ncontainer.\n    A telltale sign of loss of this vacuum<sup>1</sup> --and a possibly contaminated product--is a can\nwith bulging ends. If a seal is not airtight, bacteria may enter the can, multiply, and \ncontaminate the product. ...\n\n- Dale Blumenthal\nexcerpted and adapted from \"The Canning Process\"\n<i>FDA Consumer</i>, September 1990\n\n<sup>1</sup>vacuum - an airtight seal"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"WORD","content":"The passage ends with a tip to avoid purchasing soiled foods, as it states that a sign of a loss of vacuum (and potential contamination) is a can with bulging ends."}},"question":"The passage concludes with a","domainId":"structure","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"61158875-e07b-468d-8940-7563aff09b55","score":0,"content":"summary of the advantages of pressurization"},{"_id":"d95c9c00-f0dc-4425-b214-839443a9dfe7","score":0,"content":"list of the best foods for preservation"},{"_id":"1d0ec2e5-2dfb-4f9c-85e5-7a96b67790ad","score":1,"content":"tip to avoid purchasing spoiled food"},{"_id":"bad64960-f5e1-442b-9e09-c798a16589f7","score":0,"content":"suggestion to shop more economically"}]}]},{"_id":"ac02b054-7ced-4bbd-966e-b5547f39cb9a","difficulty":"MEDIUM","possibleItemAnswers":[],"items":[{"_id":"4654cde2-7342-4f30-b0c2-7425bde1d6ee","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"PASSAGE","content":"    I was lucky enough to discover my passion for flying when I was very young, and to\n    indulge that passion day after day.

With more than 1 billion people around the globe still lacking access to a safe and\nreliable source of water, the $100 billion the world spends on bottled water every year could\ncertainly be put to better use creating and maintaining safe public water infrastructure\neverywhere.\n\n- Janet Larsen\nexcerpted from \"Bottled Water Boycotts: Back-to-the-Tap\nMovement Gains Momentum\"\nwww.earthpolicy.org, December 7, 2007\n\n<sup>1</sup> touting - praising or publicizing loudly or extravagantly\n<sup>2</sup> pervasive - tends to become diffused throughout every part\n<sup>3</sup> burgeoning - growing rapidly\n<sup>4</sup> cachet - influential status"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"WORD","content":"The author uses factual evidence, including facts about consumption and energy usage, in order to make the point that bottled water is wasteful."}},"question":"The author develops the passage primarily\r\nthrough the use of","domainId":"structure","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"2356f05c-93f9-42eb-9792-fdec7a381a4e","score":1,"content":"factual evidence"},{"_id":"27f90a83-1dfe-4f97-812a-a21a136a1659","score":0,"content":"cause and effect"},{"_id":"891b024c-55a6-43f7-b12b-1bf173b0b26c","score":0,"content":"descriptive narrative"},{"_id":"5cc4030e-2bed-42ba-b6f4-420dfd66e727","score":0,"content":"question and answer"}]}]},{"_id":"0a71cecf-5d54-4457-bbd7-bd99bf3aa673","difficulty":"MEDIUM","possibleItemAnswers":[],"items":[{"_id":"9dc3fa83-e969-439a-a67e-736425433d18","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"PASSAGE","content":"    To get to the blackberry patch, at the back of the farm, sometimes we drove the\npickup, which was a treat.

It seems that nothing that large could be natural-\nand then it strikes you that something so enormous could only be natural.\nAnother realization soon dawns: These rock-hard floating mountains are dangerous.\nThink not only of the 1912 <i>Titanic</i> disaster but of hundreds of other accidents, most\nrecently the sinking (with no loss of life) of the Antarctic tour ship <i>Explorer</i> in\nNovember 2007. ...\n    Now, as climate change is raising global temperatures, more icebergs are being born.\nAntarctica generates far more of them than Greenland, the source of bergs in Arctic waters.\nAntarctica's are also much larger, sometimes reaching the size of small countries. Recent\ndata show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5 degrees\nFahrenheit in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, along\nwith northwestern North America and Siberia, among the fastest warming on earth. This\njump has been implicated in the recent collapse of major ice shelves along the Antarctic\nPeninsula, including the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008. As a result, thousands of new icebergs\nhave calved, or broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate.\n    Even as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these\ndangerous beauties are far from sterile, inert masses of ice. In fact, they dramatically alter\ntheir environments biologically, chemically, and physically, making them islands of life in\nthe open sea. Knowledge of icebergs' crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem has come only\nin recent years. Observers at sea had long remarked that they attract seals, penguins, and\nseabirds, and divers had noticed that fish are more numerous near them than in the\nsurrounding sea. Now scientists are learning just what the attraction is all about.\n    Depending on their size, location, and the season, icebergs can be nurturers or\ndestroyers. During their existence-typically years from calving from an Antarctic or\nGreenlandic glacier to their gradual melting as they drift into lower latitudes-they support\nanimals on, around, even <i>inside</i> their magnificent ramparts. They fertilize the ocean with\nnutrients, boosting plankton production. Grounded bergs can shelter areas of the seafloor,\nprotecting bottom-dwelling creatures from free-floating icebergs, which can be\nbottom-scouring marauders, furrowing the seabed at depths of more than a thousand feet\nlike gigantic plows, destroying all marine life unable to move out of the way. Large bergs\ncan also trap sea ice, impeding its annual breakup and thus depriving phytoplankton (algae\nthat take their name from the Greek words for \"plant\" and \"wanderer\") of life-giving\nsunlight, breaking the food chain at its first link. ...\n    From personal experience, I know that icebergs will continue to astonish and\ncaptivate visitors to the polar regions with their size and ethereal<sup>1</sup> beauty.

He drilled us in his careful standards of doing everything the \"right way.\" He\nbroke down the steps of a recipe and made them simple. And he did so with a quiet\nauthority, insisting that we thoroughly analyze texture and flavor: \"But how does it <i>taste</i>,\nMadame Scheeld?\"\n    One morning he asked, \"Who will make <i>oeufs brouill's</i> today?\"\n    The GIs [my fellow students] were silent, so I volunteered for scrambled-egg duty.\nBugnard watched intently as I whipped some eggs and cream into a froth, got the frying pan\nvery hot, and slipped in a pat of butter, which hissed and browned in the pan.\n    \"<i>Non!</i>\" he said in horror, before I could pour the egg mixture into the pan. \"That is\nabsolutely wrong!\" ...\n    With a smile, Chef Bugnard cracked two eggs and added a dash of salt and pepper.\n\"Like <i>this</i>,\" he said, gently blending the yolks and whites together with a fork. \"Not too\nmuch.\"\n    He smeared the bottom and sides of the frying pan with butter, then gently poured the\neggs in. Keeping the heat low, he stared intently at the pan. Nothing happened. After a long\nthree minutes, the eggs began to thicken into a custard. Stirring rapidly with the fork,\nsliding the pan on and off the burner, Bugnard gently pulled the egg curds together-\"Keep\nthem a little bit loose; this is very important,\" he instructed. \"<i>Now</i> the cream or butter,\" he\nsaid, looking at me with raised eyebrows. \"This will stop the cooking, you see?\" I nodded,\nand he turned the scrambled eggs out onto a plate, sprinkled a bit of parsley around, and\nsaid, \"<i>Voila!</i>\" ...\n    It was a remarkable lesson. No dish, not even the humble scrambled egg, was too much\ntrouble for him. \"You never forget a beautiful thing that you have made,\" he said. \"Even\nafter you eat it, it stays with you-<i>always</i>.\" ...\n    I was in pure, flavorful heaven at the Cordon Bleu. Because I had already\nestablished a good basic knowledge of cookery on my own, the classes acted as a catalyst for\nnew ideas, and almost immediately my cooking improved. Before I'd started there, I would\noften put too many herbs and spices into my dishes. But now I was learning the French\ntradition of extracting the full, essential flavors from food-to make, say, a roasted chicken\ntaste really <i>chickeny</i>. ...\n    But not everything was perfect. Madame Brassart [the school's owner] had crammed\ntoo many of us into the class, and Bugnard wasn't able to give the individual\nattention I craved. There were times when I had a penetrating question to ask, or a fine\npoint that burned inside of me, and I simply wasn't able to make myself heard. All this had\nthe effect of making me work even harder.\n    I had always been content to live a butterfly life of fun, with hardly a care in the world.\nBut at the Cordon Bleu, and in the markets and restaurants of Paris, I suddenly\ndiscovered that cooking was a rich and layered and endlessly fascinating subject.

The two\nbecame the perfect match for inventor Richard M. Hollingshead Jr. when he combined\nthem and opened the first drive-in movie theater in Camden, New Jersey, in the summer\nof 1933.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollingshead somehow knew that this type of movie theater could eventually prove\nsuccessful, basing his assumption on the fact that a certain segment of the population never\nattended indoor movie houses. He felt confident that once his concept became a reality,\npeople would love the idea of watching movies from inside their automobiles, and he was\nright.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families were drawn to drive-in movie theaters due in part to their convenience. More\nthan just a movie was offered to the ticket holder: There was no need to get all dressed up,\nyou didn't have to hire a babysitter, parking was included in the price of the ticket, and\ndinner was just a quick walk to the concession stand. Drive-ins also became popular with\nteenagers because it was the ideal place to take a date or socialize with \"the gang.\" What\ncould be better than dinner and a movie under the stars?\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the latter part of the 1930s, a depressed economy and a world war were just two\nof the reasons for the somewhat slow development of drive-in movie theaters. All of that\nwould change by the mid-1940s.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, America flourished. With a booming economy, hoards of families flocked\nto the suburbs. The setting was perfect for the success of drive-ins. There was plenty of\naffordable, available land and the \"car culture\" in America was just beginning.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1950s was the golden age for drive-in movie theaters. More than 4,600 were\nopened for business during the prosperous and defining decade of the baby boom. To lure\nin the family trade, playgrounds were built for children while live bands entertained adults.\nNever mind that the movies were second-rate as was the sound quality-it was the\n\"drive-in experience\" that kept moviegoers coming back for more.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the decade neared an end, so did the popularity of going to the drive-in. By the\nmid-1960s and well into the 1970s, \"the drive-in experience\" had become somewhat\ntiresome. The inferior quality of the movies being shown combined with the antiquated\nsound system led many customers back to indoor theaters.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1980s more and more drive-ins began closing down for good. Many owners\njumped at the chance to sell their lots to land developers as a means of getting out of\na sagging business. ...\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with all its adversity and struggle, the drive-in movie theater has endured. It has\nwithstood the test of time and has become a symbol for a public that is not quite ready to\ngive up on its nostalgic past.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today many drive-ins appear to be enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Owners and\noperators, taking pride in their establishments, are now offering Dolby sound along with\nfirst-run movie releases. What began as the idea of one man in Camden, New Jersey, has\nbecome a cultural icon for over half a century.

Now the woman in the seat shifted uncomfortably and\nglanced quickly at me. Perhaps she knew Worleys too.\n    I asked him to introduce me to anyone named Worley, someone who might be able to\nfill in the gaps in my family tree. The day before I had tracked down an ancestor in the\ncounty courthouse archives, a many-great grandfather Daniel. There I made a photocopy\nof his 1836 will, a list of his worldly goods, which were spare and simple: a spinning wheel,\na splitting maul, two heifers.<sup>2</sup> His farm had been in this part of the county, and checking the\nphone book in the Roman Diner I had found a dozen Worleys listed in Pillar City.\n    I didn't explain all of this to the man and woman in the green truck, but they agreed to\nlead me to a house where some Worleys lived. I followed them down another road, a flat,\nwell-graveled route leading straight toward the Upper Tamark Creek. The road made a\nsharp bend at the banks of the creek, and the woman in the truck ahead of me stuck her\narm out of the window, pointing at a two-story frame house sheathed in gray stone halfway\nup. A man was in the side yard, weaving a riding lawnmower around stumps, an overturned\nrowboat, outbuildings, and the carcasses of nameless machines. All the man seemed to be\ndoing was mulching leaves. I pulled into the horseshoe driveway, a little uneasy that the\ngreen truck had not stopped and was now crossing the bridge over the Tamark. ...\n\n- Naton Leslie\nexcerpted from \"Lost\"\n<i>Marconi's Dream</i>, 2002\nTexas Review Press\n\n<sup>1</sup>anthracite - a hard coal\n<sup>2</sup>heifers - young cows"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"WORD","content":"In lines 4-5, the author describes Pillar City by using a simile, as the town was like a train wreck.

Within twelve years he had become\none of the country's leading urban planners. Ironically, Gruen's intention was not to create\na new and more efficient way of shopping but to recreate in America something of the\nunrushed cafe-society atmosphere of European city centers. Shopping centers-or\n<i>shopping towns</i>, as he preferred to call them-were to be gathering places for the\nneighborhood, focal points of the community where people could stroll and meet their\nfriends, dally over a coffee or an ice cream, and only incidentally shop. Gruen was\nconvinced that he was designing a system that would slow suburban sprawl and tame the\nautomobile. How wrong he was. ...\n    Shopping centers didn't just transform towns, they often effectively created them. In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4-Macy's Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores' Bergen Mall. Within a\ndecade, Paramus's population had more than quadrupled to 25,000 and its retail sales had\nshot up from $5 million to $125 million. Much the same thing happened to Schaumburg,\nIllinois. In 1956, it had 130 people. Then two things happened: O'Hare became Chicago's\nmain airport and the Woodfield Shopping Center, with over two million square feet of retail\nspace, was opened. By 1978, Schaumburg's population had increased almost four-hundredfold\nto fifty thousand and it was on course to become the second-biggest city in Illinois after\nChicago by the turn of the century.\n    As shopping centers blossomed, downtowns began to die. Between 1948 and 1954, at\nthe height of America's postwar economic boom, downtown retailers in America's thirteen\nlargest cities lost on average a quarter of their business. One by one, downtowns grew more\nlifeless as stores and offices fled to the suburbs. Hudson's Department Store in Detroit\nclosed after watching its annual sales fall from $153 million in 1953 to $45 million in 1981,\nits last year-the victim, ironically of the automobile, the product that had brought Detroit\nits wealth. Sears closed its flagship store on State Street in Chicago in 1983. All over\nAmerica, where downtown department stores survived it was as a matter of pride or of tax\nbreaks, and seldom one of commercial logic. ...\n    Mall shopping had become America's biggest leisure activity. Mall of America of\nMinneapolis, the country's biggest mall with 4.2 million square feet of consumer-intensive\nspace (still considerably less than the world's biggest, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,\nwith 5.2 million square feet), was forecast to attract more people than the Grand Canyon in\nits first year of business. By the early 1990s, Americans were spending on average twelve\nhours a month in shopping malls, more than they devoted to almost any activity other than\nsleeping, eating, working, and watching television.\n    And what of Victor Gruen, the man who had started it all?

They all moved downstream in a ghostly procession,\nseparated by jagged black lines where the water was bare. The edges crunched when they\ntouched and hissed when they swept by. In the center of the river, where the current ran\nswifter, a band of floes moved much more quickly than those near the sides.\n    The moon was full, which would make the footing easier for Susan, for she must jump\nfrom floe to floe to cross the river. We stood alone-hand in hand at the edge of water, our\nskin separated by the wool of our mittens. No other eyes, no other soul, would watch her\ngo. Silence, stillness, cold. They chimed about us as one snowy chord. ...\n    When I saw Susan step upon the ice, I bit my lower lip till the blood flowed down my\nchin and crusted in the cold. Here the riverbank was no higher than a step, as from house\nto yard. In the moonlight, new snow like sugar glittered atop the sheet of ice lying along the\nbank. Behind her, in a lengthening path, Susan's footprints indented the sparkling snow. She\nmoved toward the center of the river as calmly as though crossing a broad\nmoonlit road cut through the brush and trees of the wilderness.\n    When she came to the first black edge, she stepped across the open water as though it\nwere a mere stream. The next floe was smaller, and the next even smaller; they dipped or\ntilted slightly when she stepped onto them. The spans of open water between them seemed\nwider and wider, and sometimes she waited for the current to bring the ice rafts closer\ntogether. Then she leapt the narrowed fissure and walked on. ...\n    As the current accelerated and the spaces between floes widened, Susan ran and\njumped from raft to raft; my heart hung in the air with her. In the center of the river, the\nswifter current zipped the ice rafts downstream, with Susan standing on one of them.

Here the riverbank was no higher than a step, as from house\nto yard. In the moonlight, new snow like sugar glittered atop the sheet of ice lying along the\nbank.

The next floe was smaller, and the next even smaller; they dipped or\ntilted slightly when she stepped onto them. The spans of open water between them seemed\nwider and wider, and sometimes she waited for the current to bring the ice rafts closer\ntogether. Then she leapt the narrowed fissure and walked on. ...\n    As the current accelerated and the spaces between floes widened, Susan ran and\njumped from raft to raft; my heart hung in the air with her.

So it was almost by accident that a new world of cycling was\nopened to people with disabilities. ...\n    \"The disabled community picked up on it right away,\" said Ian Lawless, Colorado\nregional director and cycling director for Adaptive Adventures. Even people with one\nworking arm can handcycle with some modifications made to the equipment, said Lawless.\n\"Just about anyone can do it. It's an accessible sport. It's not just for racing; it's also for\nrecreational riding. It's a barrier breaker that allows a disabled rider to participate in cycling\nwith friends and families who may be riding conventional bicycles.\"\n    In the 25 years since its development, handcycling has continued to grow in popularity.\nIt's been part of the IPC [International Paralympic Committee] cycling program since 1998,\nand the 2004 Paralympics included handcycling racing for the first time. Today, thousands\nof people, able-bodied and those with disabilities, have turned to handcycling as a means to\nimprove their cardiovascular health, increase upper-body strength, compete, and ride with\nfriends and family. ...\n    An upright handcycle is an entry-level bike for those who are new to the sport, who just\nwant exercise or recreation, or who don't want to ride very long distances or go very fast.\nBecause of their higher center of gravity, upright handcycles aren't suitable for speeds\nhigher than 15 mph. The internal gear systems, borrowed from the cycling industry,\nusually come in a choice of three or seven speeds, which naturally limits the speed to less\nthan 15 mph. They are easy to transfer in and out of from a wheelchair, and have a natural,\nfork-type steering system.\n    Recumbent<sup>1</sup> handcycles come in a few different variations. There are two steering\noptions: fork-steer and lean-to-steer, and two seating options: one where the rider reclines\nand the other, a \"trunk-power\" version, where the rider leans forward. They usually come\nwith 27-gear drivetrains,<sup>2</sup> although they can be purchased with three- or seven-gear\ndrivetrains.\n    The trunk-power handcycle doesn't have much of a seatback. The cranks are low to the\nground and far away from the rider. With this arrangement, riders are able to put the weight\nof their trunks behind each stroke, allowing them to go faster for longer. The limitation to\nthis type of handcycle, Lawless said, is that the athlete must have control of most or all of\nhis abdominal muscles, so it may not be suitable for all athletes.\n    With the other seating option, the rider sits in a seat with a reclined back. The cranks\nare higher and closer, allowing the rider to use the seatback for leverage to rotate the\ncranks. ...\n    The lean-to-steer version has a two-piece frame where the top frame swivels over the\nbottom frame. The front wheel turns along with the seat. The rider initiates the turn by\nleaning his whole body. There is a bit of a learning curve with this type, but many riders\nprefer this type because they have a feel similar to monoskiing.<sup>3</sup> They're used primarily, but\nnot exclusively, by people with lower-level disabilities. Lawless said there's no advantage of\none type of steering over the other. It's primarily a matter of the athlete's preference. ...\n\n- Disabled Sports USA excerpted from \"Handcycling 101\" Challenge Magazine, Spring 2005 https://www.dsusa.org\n\n<sup>1</sup> recumbent - reclining\n<sup>2</sup> drivetrain - pedal connected to the gears to make the bike move forward\n<sup>3</sup> monoskiing - one ski for both feet, using the whole body to steer"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"WORD","content":"The passage refers to handcycling as a \"barrier breaker\" because it allows more individuals to participate in the sport, meaning it increases accessibility."}},"question":"The passage includes the quotation about the handcycle being a \"barrier breaker\" (line 8) in order to stress its","domainId":"language","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"c1c9bbb5-e372-4103-8a58-0b328eb99321","score":0,"content":"durability"},{"_id":"ebc8d2dc-3830-4fe6-98d8-cd296e3ba297","score":0,"content":"affordability"},{"_id":"29c2f4b2-1bc1-40f5-8e2d-1145fe9efe76","score":0,"content":"portability"},{"_id":"b4b8ed69-0321-4311-b93f-951f59e64fe9","score":1,"content":"accessibility"}]},{"_id":"ec79f550-3af6-453b-ae12-48f14f929a97","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"PASSAGE","content":"    Handcycling was developed in the 1980s by people working to create alternate types of\nhuman-powered vehicles.

They are easy to transfer in and out of from a wheelchair, and have a natural,\nfork-type steering system.\n    Recumbent<sup>1</sup> handcycles come in a few different variations. There are two steering\noptions: fork-steer and lean-to-steer, and two seating options: one where the rider reclines\nand the other, a \"trunk-power\" version, where the rider leans forward. They usually come\nwith 27-gear drivetrains,2 although they can be purchased with three- or seven-gear\ndrivetrains.\n    The trunk-power handcycle doesn't have much of a seatback. The cranks are low to the\nground and far away from the rider. With this arrangement, riders are able to put the weight\nof their trunks behind each stroke, allowing them to go faster for longer. The limitation to\nthis type of handcycle, Lawless said, is that the athlete must have control of most or all of\nhis abdominal muscles, so it may not be suitable for all athletes.\n    With the other seating option, the rider sits in a seat with a reclined back. The cranks\nare higher and closer, allowing the rider to use the seatback for leverage to rotate the\ncranks. ...\n    The lean-to-steer version has a two-piece frame where the top frame swivels over the\nbottom frame. The front wheel turns along with the seat. The rider initiates the turn by\nleaning his whole body. There is a bit of a learning curve with this type, but many riders\nprefer this type because they have a feel similar to monoskiing.3 They're used primarily, but\nnot exclusively, by people with lower-level disabilities. Lawless said there's no advantage of\none type of steering over the other. It's primarily a matter of the athlete's preference. ...\n\n- Disabled Sports USA excerpted from \"Handcycling 101\" Challenge Magazine, Spring 2005 https://www.dsusa.org\n\n<sup>1</sup> recumbent - reclining\n<sup>2</sup> drivetrain - pedal connected to the gears to make the bike move forward\n<sup>3</sup> monoskiing - one ski for both feet, using the whole body to steer"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"WORD","content":"The third paragraph begins by saying that handcycling has continued to grow in popularity.

Within twelve years he had become\none of the country's leading urban planners. Ironically, Gruen's intention was not to create\na new and more efficient way of shopping but to recreate in America something of the\nunrushed cafe-society atmosphere of European city centers. Shopping centers-or\n<i>shopping towns</i>, as he preferred to call them-were to be gathering places for the\nneighborhood, focal points of the community where people could stroll and meet their\nfriends, dally over a coffee or an ice cream, and only incidentally shop. Gruen was\nconvinced that he was designing a system that would slow suburban sprawl and tame the\nautomobile. How wrong he was. ...\n    Shopping centers didn't just transform towns, they often effectively created them. In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4-Macy's Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores' Bergen Mall. Within a\ndecade, Paramus's population had more than quadrupled to 25,000 and its retail sales had\nshot up from $5 million to $125 million. Much the same thing happened to Schaumburg,\nIllinois. In 1956, it had 130 people. Then two things happened: O'Hare became Chicago's\nmain airport and the Woodfield Shopping Center, with over two million square feet of retail\nspace, was opened. By 1978, Schaumburg's population had increased almost four-hundredfold\nto fifty thousand and it was on course to become the second-biggest city in Illinois after\nChicago by the turn of the century.\n    As shopping centers blossomed, downtowns began to die. Between 1948 and 1954, at\nthe height of America's postwar economic boom, downtown retailers in America's thirteen\nlargest cities lost on average a quarter of their business. One by one, downtowns grew more\nlifeless as stores and offices fled to the suburbs. Hudson's Department Store in Detroit\nclosed after watching its annual sales fall from $153 million in 1953 to $45 million in 1981,\nits last year-the victim, ironically of the automobile, the product that had brought Detroit\nits wealth. Sears closed its flagship store on State Street in Chicago in 1983. All over\nAmerica, where downtown department stores survived it was as a matter of pride or of tax\nbreaks, and seldom one of commercial logic. ...\n    Mall shopping had become America's biggest leisure activity. Mall of America of\nMinneapolis, the country's biggest mall with 4.2 million square feet of consumer-intensive\nspace (still considerably less than the world's biggest, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,\nwith 5.2 million square feet), was forecast to attract more people than the Grand Canyon in\nits first year of business. By the early 1990s, Americans were spending on average twelve\nhours a month in shopping malls, more than they devoted to almost any activity other than\nsleeping, eating, working, and watching television.\n    And what of Victor Gruen, the man who had started it all? Appalled at what he had\nunleashed, he fled back to Vienna, where he died in 1980, a disappointed man.\n\n- Bill Bryson\nexcerpted from Made in <i>America</i>, 1994\nWilliam Morrow and Company\n\n<sup>1</sup>Austrian Anschluss - the annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"WORD","content":"The idea was to create a space for socializing, as indicated in Lines 6-9.

In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4-Macy's Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores' Bergen Mall. Within a\ndecade, Paramus's population had more than quadrupled to 25,000 and its retail sales had\nshot up from $5 million to $125 million. Much the same thing happened to Schaumburg,\nIllinois. In 1956, it had 130 people. Then two things happened: O'Hare became Chicago's\nmain airport and the Woodfield Shopping Center, with over two million square feet of retail\nspace, was opened. By 1978, Schaumburg's population had increased almost four-hundredfold\nto fifty thousand and it was on course to become the second-biggest city in Illinois after\nChicago by the turn of the century.\n    As shopping centers blossomed, downtowns began to die. Between 1948 and 1954, at\nthe height of America's postwar economic boom, downtown retailers in America's thirteen\nlargest cities lost on average a quarter of their business. One by one, downtowns grew more\nlifeless as stores and offices fled to the suburbs. Hudson's Department Store in Detroit\nclosed after watching its annual sales fall from $153 million in 1953 to $45 million in 1981,\nits last year-the victim, ironically of the automobile, the product that had brought Detroit\nits wealth. Sears closed its flagship store on State Street in Chicago in 1983. All over\nAmerica, where downtown department stores survived it was as a matter of pride or of tax\nbreaks, and seldom one of commercial logic. ...\n    Mall shopping had become America's biggest leisure activity. Mall of America of\nMinneapolis, the country's biggest mall with 4.2 million square feet of consumer-intensive\nspace (still considerably less than the world's biggest, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,\nwith 5.2 million square feet), was forecast to attract more people than the Grand Canyon in\nits first year of business. By the early 1990s, Americans were spending on average twelve\nhours a month in shopping malls, more than they devoted to almost any activity other than\nsleeping, eating, working, and watching television.\n    And what of Victor Gruen, the man who had started it all?

So the area of a trapezoid can also be thought of as</p>\n\n<p>\\[Area = (average\\ of\\ bases) \\times h\\]</p>\n\n<p>You can review properties of trapezoids here:\n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/trapezoid.html\">https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/trapezoid.html</a></p>\n\n<p>And for a general overview of quadrilaterals, see:\n<a href=\"https://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/quadrilaterals\">https://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/quadrilaterals</a></p>\n"}},"question":"What is the area of the trapezoid?","domainId":"geometry","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"acbdc926-705b-4daf-8a08-9c7b02c4621c","score":0,"content":"\\( 95.46 in.^{2} \\)"},{"_id":"f8e933aa-f437-474a-9649-ac40d413bd53","score":0,"content":"\\( 57.72 in.^{2} \\)"},{"_id":"31389bdb-5932-47a4-8c7a-5b0ae819175b","score":1,"content":"\\( 47.73 in.^{2} \\)"},{"_id":"271191e1-14b5-480a-a6cc-d9d683526fda","score":0,"content":"\\( 34.70 in.^{2} \\)"}]},{"_id":"6df989f1-16cf-40e2-9e18-ea4ac88d7f04","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":""},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":"<p>The <em>x-intercept</em> of a line, or any graph on the\n<em>Cartesian plane</em> (that&#39;s the actual name of the x-y axes), is the point\nwhere the graph crosses the x-axis.</p>\n\n<p>In Graph A, the x-intercept is x = -2, so this is the correct choice.</p>\n\n<p>In Graph B, the x-intercept is x = <U+00BD>.</p>\n\n<p>In Graph C, the x-intercept is x = 0.</p>\n\n<p>In Graph D, the x-intercept is x = 2.</p>\n\n<p>For graphs of functions more complicated than lines, there may be more\nthan one x-intercept, and the x-intercepts are called the <em>roots</em> or\n<em>zeros</em> of the function.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a graph\nhere:\n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/finding-intercepts-equation.html\">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/finding-intercepts-equation.html</a></p>\n\n<p>And</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.virtualnerd.com/pre-algebra/linear-functions-graphing/x-y-intercepts-from-slope-intercept.php\">https://www.virtualnerd.com/pre-algebra/linear-functions-graphing/x-y-intercepts-from-slope-intercept.php</a></p>\n"}},"question":"Which of the following graphs represents a line that has an x-intercept of -2?","domainId":"lines_and_functions","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"3bf87262-af2d-4e51-af11-735922f14bbf","score":1,"content":"<img src=\"https://cdn.daacs.net/uploads/math_images/question_possible_answer_0_6df989f1-16cf-40e2-9e18-ea4ac88d7f04_0.png\">"},{"_id":"0551195e-b12a-4c0b-a7b1-7c1ce4ebe6bf","score":0,"content":"<img src=\"https://cdn.daacs.net/uploads/math_images/question_possible_answer_1_6df989f1-16cf-40e2-9e18-ea4ac88d7f04_0.png\">"},{"_id":"b2e1c427-3663-414b-a504-ecea51456454","score":0,"content":"<img src=\"https://cdn.daacs.net/uploads/math_images/question_possible_answer_2_6df989f1-16cf-40e2-9e18-ea4ac88d7f04_0.png\">"},{"_id":"a4f972fd-f055-46e0-804a-7a83aad12aca","score":0,"content":"<img src=\"https://cdn.daacs.net/uploads/math_images/question_possible_answer_3_6df989f1-16cf-40e2-9e18-ea4ac88d7f04_0.png\">"}]},{"_id":"444a51c7-113a-418d-8b7a-f2bc1ca594d0","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":"Which point on the number line below is closest to the value of \\( \\sqrt{152} \\)?<br/>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.daacs.net/uploads/math_images/question_content_444a51c7-113a-418d-8b7a-f2bc1ca594d0_0.png\">"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":"<p>he two perfect squares that are closest to 152 are 144\nand 169.

Notice that the first equation has the expression\n<em>2y</em> in it as well, so we can take our new expression for <em>2y</em> and\nsubstitute it in place of the <em>2y</em> in the first equation, like this:</p>\n\n<p>\\[3x - 2y = 6\\]</p>\n\n<p>\\[3x - (10 - x) = 6\\]</p>\n\n<p>Now we have an equation with only one variable, and we can solve for\n<em>x</em>. The order of operations</p>\n\n<p>\\[3x - 10 + x = 6\\]</p>\n\n<p>(remember that two negatives make a positive: &ndash;x = +x). Combine 3x + x\n= 4x:</p>\n\n<p>\\[4x - 10 = 6\\]</p>\n\n<p>Then add 10 to both sides</p>\n\n<p>\\[4x = 16\\]</p>\n\n<p>And divide by 4.</p>\n\n<p>\\[x = 4\\]</p>\n\n<p>You can review strategies for solving systems of equations here:\n<a href=\"https://www.virtualnerd.com/algebra-2/linear-systems/equations-solution-by-substitution.php\">https://www.virtualnerd.com/algebra-2/linear-systems/equations-solution-by-substitution.php</a></p>\n\n<p>Or a slightly more complicated example here:\n<a href=\"https://www.virtualnerd.com/algebra-1/systems-equations-inequalities/two-equations-two-variables-substitution.php\">https://www.virtualnerd.com/algebra-1/systems-equations-inequalities/two-equations-two-variables-substitution.php</a></p>\n"}},"question":"What is the value of x in the solution of the system of equations below?","domainId":"variables_and_equations","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"430d6bad-f9ae-4423-a8b9-e27ed7495054","score":0,"content":"2"},{"_id":"5d44530b-9cb0-4b0e-a837-18491dc7b963","score":1,"content":"4"},{"_id":"9e5a3ff8-c08b-41e8-8e61-6b3969e1df1f","score":0,"content":"10"},{"_id":"9e60ad7a-e724-4225-9d5b-4c3d87545de5","score":0,"content":"16"}]},{"_id":"edbc1b04-806f-4cb8-945e-935474c74e87","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":"<meta>The length of a rectangular patio is 7 feet more than its width, \\(w\\).

Using the two points given,</p>\n\n<p>\\[m = \\frac{(4 - 1)}{( - 2 - - 1)} = \\frac{3}{- 2 + 1} = \\frac{3}{- 1} = - 3\\]</p>\n\n<p>The slope is -3. Now to find the equation of the line, we use the\n<em>point-intercept form</em> of the equation of the line:</p>\n\n<p>\\[\\left( y - y_{1} \\right) = m(x - x_{1})\\]</p>\n\n<p>We need to use one of the provided points for (x~1~, y~1~). We can use\neither one, but from looking at the 1s in the answer choices, it looks\nlike we should use (x~1~, y~1~)=(-1,1).</p>\n\n<p>Substitute the slope and the point into the point-slope form of the\nequation and we get:</p>\n\n<p>\\[\\left( y - 1 \\right) = - 3(x - - 1)\\]</p>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<p>\\[y - 1 = - 3(x + 1)\\]</p>\n\n<p>Which is choice B.</p>\n\n<p>You can review calculating the slope and the point-slope form of the\nequation of a line here:\n<a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html\">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html</a></p>\n\n<p>If you want to brush up on working with positive and negative numbers,\nsee: <a href=\"https://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/integer-add-and-sub\">https://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/integer-add-and-sub</a></p>\n\n<p>And</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/integer-multiply-and-divide\">https://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/integer-multiply-and-divide</a></p>\n"}},"question":"Which of the following equations represents the line?","domainId":"lines_and_functions","possibleItemAnswers":[{"_id":"9f84537d-6482-4ea9-978b-73737a774d2b","score":0,"content":"\\( y-1= -\\frac{1}{3}(x-1) \\)"},{"_id":"165882ce-4ca8-4d2e-aba5-d20c437a88e8","score":1,"content":"\\( y-1=-3(x+1) \\)"},{"_id":"8a22437d-3be4-4e1f-9b24-b68b9e778151","score":0,"content":"\\( y-1= -\\frac{1}{3}(x+1) \\)"},{"_id":"314579ba-fca0-44be-9815-e50cca81d9a2","score":0,"content":"\\( y-1=-3(x-1) \\)"}]},{"_id":"48c4ef89-4b4a-42c6-9da0-50a7a1cea73f","itemContent":{"question":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":"<p>Given \\(f^{-1}(x)=-\\frac{3}{4}x\\ +\\ 2\\), which equation represents \\(f(x)\\)?</p>\n<p><br></p>"},"feedback":{"itemContentType":"FORMULA","content":"<p>The inverse of a function \\(f(x)\\) is written as \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), and it represents another function with the property that&nbsp;\\(f(f^{-1}(x))&nbsp;= 1\\) and&nbsp;\\(f^{1}(f(x))&nbsp;= 1\\).

The bar\nover the 60 is 6 units high, which means that there were six students\nwho were 60 inches tall. To make it easier to calculate the median and\nmean, we can re-organize the data into a table:</p>\n\n<p>Height (inches)   Number of students</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>60                6\n  61                5\n  62                4\n  63                3\n  64                2</p>\n\n<p>By adding up the number of students at each height, we can find that\nthere were 6+5+4+3+2=20 students measured.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>median</em> height is the middle value, when the values are listed in\norder.

In evaluating a series of calculations, we need to use\nthe correct <em>order of operations.</em> To ensure that everyone evaluates a\nmathematical expression in the same way, mathematicians have adopted\nsome conventions, or standards, for the order in which operations are\ndone. To ensure consistency, all mathematical expressions are evaluated\nin the order often abbreviated as <strong>PEMDAS</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Parentheses</strong>: Whatever is inside parentheses happens first. If\nthere are several sets of parentheses, start with the innermost\nparentheses first, and follow the correct order of operations within\nthose parentheses.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Exponents</strong> are evaluated next.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Multiplication and Division</strong> are next.

Notice that in the middle part of the expression, there is one\nmultiplication and one division in this expression (the dot <U+00B7> is\nshorthand for multiplication). This is where the calculation gets a\nlittle tricky: when performing multiplication and division, we always\nread from left to right, and evaluate them in the order that we see\nthem.

This is a very positive thing because it means that you probably are not afraid of trying hard and persisting even when something is difficult, and view mistakes as a natural part of learning. The two scenarios below illustrate the distinction between a fixed and growth mindset, and how mindset influences behavior.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong>: Ben received a poor grade on his science midterm and was quick to label himself as &ldquo;bad at science&rdquo; and &ldquo;a failure&rdquo;. Ben decided he was not capable of doing well on the final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that: Why would he put the effort into studying if it wouldn&#39;t make a difference? Feeling defeated, Ben stopped paying attention in class and barely studied for the final exam. </p>\n\n<p><strong>GROWTH</strong>: Nicole took the same science midterm and also received a poor grade. Nicole thought she must not have studied well enough. Although she was disappointed with the grade, Nicole understood that she could improve if she put in more effort and studied the material more thoroughly. Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clear up confusions, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To learn more about a growth mindset and how to sustain it, click on the <strong>Learn</strong>, <strong>See</strong>, and/or <strong>Do</strong> buttons below. </p>\n\n<h2>Your Assessment Responses</h2>\n","contentSummary":"<p>You exhibit the thinking of someone with a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, which means that you correctly believe that your intelligence and abilities can change over time with effort: The harder you try, the more intelligent and capable you become.\n</p>\n\n<p>To maintain your beneficial growth mindset:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li> Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome.</li>\n    <li> View mistakes as a natural part of learning.</li>\n    <li> Pay attention to the things you say to yourself.

Taking the practice tests tells me which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered.&rdquo; Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned this strategy. She told him that her high school teacher told her to do practice problems but she never understood their value until she read the SRL feedback.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like many students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to use the same study approach regardless of the class. His approach was often ineffective, but he didn&#39;t know what else to do. </p>\n\n<p>All students can benefit from learning new ways to learn.

Some paragraphs might lack a\nclear focus on a main idea or might have too many ideas for a reader to follow\neasily.
